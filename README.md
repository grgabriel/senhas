# Simple ticketing system to display on a local computer

This app will render a webpage with a message to prompt the user to get a ticket number.

When pressed it will print out a ticket with a number from 1-99 in order using the local printer. In its implementation a Brother TD-4100N receipt printer was used, it can easily be adapted to any printer by changing the function in lin_funcs.py

The only user interaction is a click or press on the link, it is intended to be run on a local machine with no internet connectivity or other input allowed.
